Analyzing PH-Employee database with SQL

## **Overview of analysis**

Pewlett Hackard management team wants to know the number of current employees retiring based on their age and hiring dates. Also, the company wants to offer some of its retiring employees into mentorship programs where they will be training the new comers. To perform this analysis we have made use of the CSV files to build our database and query on top of it for the desired results.


## **Results**

### 1. From the SQL output, there are 90,398 employees eligible for retirement based on their age (born between 1952 and 1955) across seven different title categories.

2. The Senior engineers and senior staff together constitute greater than 50% of the employees nearing retirement.


3. Of all the retiring employees, 1549 employees born between (January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965) are eligible for mentorship program.

4. This further says , only 1.7% of overall employees nearing retirement are eligible for mentorship program 

 ### Summary 

 
Analysis shows, 90,398 employees are nearing their retirement age which constitutes 30% of all the employees in the company. The highest number of retirement ready employees are Senior Engineers and the least being managers. Further, only 1.7% out of the 30% retirement ready employees are eligible for mentoring programs. This shows company will need to hire 90,398 employees as the 'Silver Tsunami' begins to impact and it doesn't have enough resources to mentor the next generation of the company.
